This Shiny application is a very simple Golf game.

Every time the application is run, a random location for the hole is set, and 
it is plotted as a red triangle. The user must then choose an appropriate start
speed (in meters per second) and angle (in degrees) to make the ball enter the 
hole in one shot (a hole in one). There is no limit as to the number of tries.

The velocity and the trajectory of the ball are affected by a gravity of 9.8
meters/second^2. Both the x and y components of the chart correspond to meters.

Whenever the user has hit the hole with a ball, (s)he can refresh the page to 
get a different hole location and play again.
